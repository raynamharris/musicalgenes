## About

Genes work together in concert to regulate behavior. What does this 'transcriptional symphony' sound like? Data sonification is the presentation of data as sound. Musical Genes is a Shiny app that allows users to interactively visualize and sonify (or plot and play) gene expression to better understand the biology of parental care. The user can choose a gene from this pulldown menu and listen to how it changes over time with the R packages `sonify` and `tuneR`. We also represent the levels of gene expression as notes on a scale that could be played on an instrument like a piano or guitar. Finally, we provide multiple visualizations that provide additional insight into genes that might work in concert to regulate biological processes of biomedical relevance.
