CDH19,"CDH19 encodes a calcium dependent cell-cell adhesion protein (O’Leary et al., 2016)."
CEBPD,"CEBPD upregulates in response to CORT and restraint stress. This gene encodes a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein that acts as transcription factor and responds to glucocorticoids (Ko et al., 2015). These proteins act in metabolism, adipogenesis, immune and inflammatory responses, and PRL regulation (Ko et al., 2015; Tong et al., 2011). Tong et al. (Tong et al., 2011) suggest that PRL expression and lactotroph cell proliferation in the pituitary are linked: CEBPD plays a key role in coordinating their actions. Forced expression of CEBPD suppressed PRL expression in PRL-secreting cells and lactotroph proliferation in rats by binding to the PRL promoter (Tong et al., 2011). CEBPD may also be activated by a number of inflammatory factors such as PGE2 (Ko et al., 2015). Transcription of CEBPD following an inflammatory stimuli can be activated by a number of signaling pathways including JAK (Ko et al., 2015). Thus, upregulation of this gene may increase inflammatory responsiveness and suppress prolactin synthesis in response to a stressor or environmental perturbation. This gene is another potential target for understanding the role of CORT on the inflammatory response and suppression of reproduction."
CISH,"CISH is another shared gene that upregulates in response to both restraint stress and CORT treatments. CISH is an immediate early gene that is involved in negative feedback of the Jak2-Stat5 pathway (Dif et al., 2001; Matsumoto et al., 1997). The CISH protein competitively binds to phosphorylated prolactin receptors (PRLr), which attenuates Stat5 binding and subsequent downstream pathway signaling (Dif et al., 2001; Radhakrishnan et al., 2012). This action is one way that CISH may inhibit prolactin transcription and downstream events of the Jak-Stat pathway. Evidence also suggests that cytokines are important cell-signaling molecules that play a role in the inflammatory response (Yasukawa et al., 2000). Thus, if increased CISH activity is indicative of decreased cytokine activity or attenuation of PRLr binding, this could be a possible mechanism by which stress could influence both immune function and parental care."
CITED2,"CITED2 encodes a protein that competitively binds to hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A) thereby inhibiting expression of HIF1A-induced genes (O’Leary et al., 2016)."
CKMT1A,"CKMT1A encodes mitochondrial creatine kinase, which acts in movement of phosphate to creatine within the mitochondria thereby functioning in cell metabolism (O’Leary et al., 2016). It also plays a critical role in regulating the permeability transition pore where downregulation leads to the depolarization of mitochondria and apoptosis (Datler et al., 2014)."
CNP,"CNP encodes a protein that encodes a precursor of NPCC (C-type natriuretic peptide). NPCC is associated with vasodilation and natriuresis. (O’Leary et al., 2016)"
CREB5,"CREB5 encodes a cAMP response element (CRE) binding protein (Yu et al., 2018). CREB5 regulates cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, and may be involved in the immune response (Yu et al., 2018). Recent work showed that hypo-methylation and upregulation of CREB5 in decidua was associated with recurrent pregnancy loss in humans (Yu et al., 2018)."
DAAM2,"DAAM2 helps regulate the planar cell polarity pathway, a Wnt signaling pathway (Lee et al., 2015). Daam2 appears to inhibit the differentiation of oligodendrocytes thereby impacting myelination (via the PIP5K-PIP2 axis; (Lee et al., 2015))."
DDIT4,"DDIT4 is a stress responsive gene that suppresses mTor (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) pathways (Canal et al., 2014; Polman et al., 2012). Upregulation of DDIT4 occurs following cellular damage associated with a number of stressors (Canal et al., 2014; Polman et al., 2012). DDIT4 also responds to the presence of glucocorticoids via a GRE-like element on its promoter (Polman et al., 2012). Upregulation of DDIT4 results in the suppression of the mTOR pathway, which has been associated with reduced cell growth and plasticity in several tissues and an increase in cell apoptosis (Polman et al., 2012).  Most of the research on this gene has focused on the hippocampus– its role in the pituitary has not been well-studied."
DIRAS2,DIRAS2 likely acts in GTP binding (GO:0005525) and GTPase activity (GO:0003924).

KCNJ12,"KCNJ12 encodes an inwardly rectifying K+ channel (O’Leary et al., 2016)."
KCNJ5,"KCNJ5, also known as GIRK4, is a G protein regulated inward-rectifying potassium channel upregulates in response to CORT and restraint stress. KCNJ5 is under the regulation of CORT signaling via a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) on its promoter region (Muma and Beck, 1999). GIRK channels can influence the resting membrane potential of cells by affecting the flow of potassium into the cell. Cells where KCNJ5 is upregulated are more difficult to activate. Site-specific information is required to understand specific actions of corticosterone on GIRK signaling (Muma and Beck, 1999). In the hippocampus, neuronal exposure to corticosterone results in selective activation of ligand gated receptors through GIRK1 and 2 pathways (Muma and Beck, 1999). The GIRK pathway can also act as a cellular effector of dopaminergic action on lactotrophs in the anterior pituitary (Christensen et al., 2011; Gregerson et al., 2001). Based on this action, it is feasible that upregulated KCNJ5 may decrease prolactin, via its action on lactotrophs, following acute exposure to CORT or a stressor. Prolactin is a hormone critical for supporting parental care and immune function in birds (Austin and Word, 2018). Our work did not find that PRL was differentially expressed in the pituitary of either treatment group though it upregulates in the male hypothalamus of CORT-treated birds. KCNJ5 can also influence biochemical processes associated with aldosterone production thereby influencing electrolyte balance (Bollag, 2014). Due to the influence of KCNJ5 and GIRK pathways in the hypothalamus and prolactin in the pituitary, this gene could be a potential means by which stress affects reproduction."

MMP9,"MMP9 encodes a matrix metalloproteinase from the zinc-dependent endopepdidases. MMPs act in the degradation of extracellular matrix and may be involved in matrix remodeling during tissue growth and morphogenesis (Swain et al., 2017).

NINJ2,"NINJ2 encodes a protein of the ninjurin (for nerve injury induced) family, which is a cell surface adhesion molecule that is related to nerve injury and neurite outgrowth (Wang et al., 2017). It has also been suggested as a regulator of multiple proteins associated with inflammation (GDNF, GM-CSF, ICAM-1, IL-1β, M-CSF, TGF-β1, TGF-β3, TNF-α, TNF-β, BLC, CCL28, Fractalkine, GCP-2, I-TAC, IL-8, Lymphotactin, MIP-3β, MIP-3α and TECK) and may influence the gene expression of several associated genes (GDNF, ICAM-1, IL-1β, M-CSF, TGF-β1, TGF-β3, BLC, CCL28, Fractalkine, GCP-2, I-TAC, IL-8, Lymphotactin, MIP-3β, MIP-3α and TECK), as well (Wang et al., 2017). NINJ2 and TLR4 also regulate NF-KB and c-jun pathways (Wang et al., 2017)."

PMP22,"PMP22 encodes an integral membrane protein of myelin and the peripheral nervous system (O’Leary et al., 2016)."
PTGER3,"PTGER3 increased in expression in response to both restraint stress and CORT-treatments. PTGER3 encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor, EP3, that binds to its ligand, PGE2. The binding of EP3 to PGE2 results in the activation of an inhibitory G protein that reduces adenylyl cyclase activity and causes a decline in cellular cAMP.  Prostaglandins have been linked to inflammation-induced activation of the HPA axis and act as an important immunoregulator (Furuyashiki and Narumiya, 2011; Oka, 2004; Rivest, 2001). PGE2 binds to EP1 and EP3, which promote an ACTH response (Furuyashiki and Narumiya, 2011). Recall that ACTH is synthesized in the pituitary and travels through the bloodstream where it binds to melanocortin 2 receptors in the adrenals and promotes CORT synthesis. Cytokines may also induce prostaglandin synthesis (PGE2) and EP3 activation of the HPA axis (Furuyashiki and Narumiya, 2011). EP3’s importance in inflammation-induced HPA activation was shown by a study that used addressed how EP3 knockout mice responded to an induced fever (by injecting pyrogen; (Oka, 2004)). EP3 -/- mice did not develop a fever following treatment with pyrogen whereas controls did (Oka, 2004). This result suggests that EP3 activates the HPA axis in response to illness (Oka, 2004). Activation of the HPA via EP3 also includes vasodilation of the skin and increased metabolism of brown fat (Furuyashiki and Narumiya, 2011). PTGER3 may be another means by which the HPA axis is activated, J7and critically, PTGER3 appears to be a means that the HPA axis primes itself for potential injury or infection following exposure to a stressor."
RASSF2,"RASSF2 functions in cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, actin cytoskeleton organization, apoptosis, suppression of transcription of NFKB, and inhibition of MST2 activity (Volodko et al., 2014)."

SPTBN5,"SPTBN5 encodes the beta-spectrin non-erythrocytic 5 (beta V) protein (Czogalla, 2016). While spectrins are typically function in cell structure, beta spectrins downregulation has been linked to the impairment of TGFbeta signaling and cell cycle dysregulation (Czogalla, 2016)."
SSPO,"SSPO encodes a thrombospondin type 1 repeat protein that functions in peptidase inhibitor activity (GO:0030414; (O’Leary et al., 2016))."
SEPP1L,"The function of SEP1L is unknown, but it may act as an extracellular antioxidant (O’Leary et al., 2016)."
VNN 1,"This gene encodes the Vanin-1 enzyme which is associated with pantetheinase activity (Berruyer et al., 2004). Pantothenic acid is critical for CoA synthesis (Berruyer et al., 2004). Via this pathway, the antioxidant, cysteamine, is also produced (Berruyer et al., 2004). VNN1 increased expression in response to a stressor in rodents (Berruyer et al., 2004). This gene is associated with energy metabolism in the liver and regulates glutathione-related responses to oxidative damage in the thymus (Berruyer et al., 2004). VNN1 may upregulate following stress as oxidative stress regulates its expression via an antioxidant response element (ARE)-like element on its promoter region (Berruyer et al., 2004). In a VNN1 knockout study, mice were irradiated to determine the role of VNN1 on inflammation and oxidative stress. Following irradiation, VNN1 knockout mice showed lower inflammatory responses and oxidative damage than wild type mice (Berruyer et al., 2004). While little research has been conducted on VNN1 in the ovaries, it is likely upregulated in response to glucocorticoids and restraint stress due to its role in oxidative stress and the inflammatory response."
TMEM88B,TMEM88B encodes a protein with a currently unknown function.
TNNC1,"TNNC1 encodes a regulatory protein associated with muscle contraction in the actin filament (O’Leary et al., 2016)."
TSC22D3,"TSC22D3 encodes an anti-inflammatory protein glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper that is stimulated by glucocorticoids and interleukin-10. It functions in inhibiting inflammation and the immune system. (O’Leary et al., 2016)"
TSHR,"TSHR is a gene that transcribes the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor. The thyroid stimulating hormone receptor responds to the presence of thyroid stimulating hormone, a metabolic hormone that stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Other studies have shown that glucocorticoids increase expression of TSHR in the pituitary (Mariotti and Beck-Peccoz, 2000). While this gene was upregulated, there was high variance, which suggests a trend towards increased expression of TSHR (Fig. 6). While pharmaceutical doses of glucocorticoids in rats can suppress circulating TSH, mRNA TSH, and thereby, TSHR, this study found that TSHR was upregulated (Mariotti and Beck-Peccoz, 2000). This result may indicate an increase in metabolism in response to glucocorticoids and restraint stress."
TTYH2,"TTYH2 encodes a protein that influences calcium (2+)-activated large conductance chloride(-) channels (O’Leary et al., 2016)."
UGT8,"UGT8 encodes 2-hydroxyacylsphingosine 1-beta-galactosyltransferase, which is associated with myelin (Bosio et al., 1996)."
ZBTB16,"ZBTB16 upregulates in the pituitary of males and females exposed to restraint stress and CORT. It is a transcription factor that generally acts as a transcriptional repressor, downregulating gene transcription through recruitment of other transcriptional co-repressors and histone deacetylases that modify chromatin (Costoya, 2007; McConnell and Licht, 2007). This protein has been implicated in reducing cell proliferation and increasing cell death via apoptosis in various cancer cell lines and during development (Costoya, 2007). Glucocorticoids have been shown to upregulate ZBTB16 in the brain of mice and cancer cell lines (Peppi et al., 2011; Wasim et al., 2010). While no known study has examined ZBTB16 in the pituitary, it may possibly play a role in the negative feedback of CORT on pituitary gene expression and cell proliferation. For example, ZBTB16 may repress transcription and recruit epigenetic mechanisms, to downregulate genes associated with HPA axis activity. Further, ZBTB16 may inhibit cell growth and proliferation of corticotrophs in the pituitary. Glucocorticoids have been shown to suppress growth of corticotrophic tumors (Losa et al., 2000) and have generally inhibitory effects on DNA synthesis in the pituitary (McNicol and Carbajo-Perez, 1999), possibly through a mechanism including ZBTB16. Taken together, these results suggest ZBTB16 may play a role in negative feedback of the HPA axis by affecting corticotroph transcription and cell proliferation."
