abstract = {The Alliance of Genome Resources (Alliance) is a consortium of the major model organism databases and the Gene Ontology that is guided by the vision of facilitating exploration of related genes in human and well-studied model organisms by providing a highly integrated and comprehensive platform that enables researchers to leverage the extensive body of genetic and genomic studies in these organisms. Initiated in 2016, the Alliance is building a central portal (www.alliancegenome.org) for access to data for the primary model organisms along with gene ontology data and human data. All data types represented in the Alliance portal (e.g. genomic data and phenotype descriptions) have common data models and workflows for curation. All data are open and freely available via a variety of mechanisms. Long-term plans for the Alliance project include a focus on coverage of additional model organisms including those without dedicated curation communities, and the inclusion of new data types with a particular focus on providing data and tools for the non-model-organism researcher that support enhanced discovery about human health and disease. Here we review current progress and present immediate plans for this new bioinformatics resource.},

BioJupies is a web application that enables automated generation of Jupyter Notebook reports containing complete and comprehensive RNA-seq data analysis. Through an intuitive interface, users are guided through the steps of analysis, starting from uploading their raw sequencing files to gene expression tables to selecting tools, parameters, and visualization options to generating the Jupyter Notebook. Generated notebooks have executable and customizable code of the entire pipeline, rich narrative text, and interactive data visualizations and are permanently hosted in the cloud. BioJupies is freely available at http://biojupies.cloud.},
